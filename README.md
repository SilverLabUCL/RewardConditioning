# RewardConditioning
Protocols for reward conditioning tasks

1. Water valve calibration
2. Licking

3. Conditioning (Reward after delay, Stim throughout)
4. Trace conditioning (Reward after delay, stim only in sample)

5. Operant task (Lick for reward after delay, stim throughout)
6. Operant (trace-delay) task (Lick for reward after delay, stim only in sample)

7. No anticipatory licks (No lick in delay, reward after delay)
8. Timing operant task (No lick in delay, lick for reward after delay)


For sound-cued conditioning, only protocols 1,2,4,6,7,8 are applicable as there is no sound for delay period.
